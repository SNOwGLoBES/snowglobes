This directory contains digitized files of the parameterized "Garching" flux,

from
Huedepohl et al.
http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.251101

make_garching_fluxes.C  
reads the digitized text files for each flavor and creates
garching_pinched_info.dat, which  can be substituted for pinched_info.dat to use
the "pinched" tool to create time-dependent

It also creates garching_pinched_info_key.dat, which connects each numbered
pinched flux file to the time information, which can be used later for plotting.

Example plotting files can be found in trunk/plots
garching_time_plot.C and plot_garching.C
